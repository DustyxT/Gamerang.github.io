# Video Background Optimization Guide

This document explains the optimizations made to improve the performance of video backgrounds on the Gamerang community page.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Loading

- **Intersection Observer**: Video loading only starts when the user scrolls to the page section
- **Visibility Detection**: Video loading is delayed until the page is visible in the browser
- **User Interaction**: Video loading prioritizes user interaction with the page

### 2. Adaptive Quality Selection

- **Network Speed Detection**: Automatically selects video quality based on connection speed
- **Hardware Capability Detection**: Checks for hardware acceleration support
- **Memory Usage Detection**: Falls back to static image on low-memory devices

### 3. Multiple Format Support

- **WebM (VP9)**: Most efficient format, used for supported browsers
- **H.265/HEVC**: Better compression than H.264, used when supported
- **H.264/MP4**: Universal fallback format for all browsers

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Poster Image**: Loads a static image first for immediate visual feedback
- **Preloading Hints**: Uses browser preloading for returning visitors
- **will-change Property**: Hints browser about elements that will animate
- **Connection Speed Caching**: Avoids repeated network tests

### 5. User Experience Improvements

- **Low Memory Mode**: Automatically detects and accommodates low-end devices
- **Data Saver Mode**: Respects user's data saving preferences
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's reduced motion preferences
- **Error Recovery**: Gracefully falls back when video loading fails

## Using the Video Optimizer

A utility script `video-optimizer.js` has been created to help optimize video files:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the optimizer on your video
node video-optimizer.js path/to/your/video.mp4
```

This will create optimized versions of your video in different formats and quality levels:

- High quality (original resolution, max 1280px width)
- Medium quality (854px width)
- Low quality (640px width)

Each quality level is encoded in three formats:
- WebM (VP9)
- MP4 (H.264)
- MP4 (H.265/HEVC)

## Uploading to Supabase

After optimization, upload the files to your Supabase storage bucket:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Select or create the `background-video-forum-page` bucket
4. Upload all optimized video files and the poster image
5. Make sure the bucket has public access enabled

## Best Practices for Background Videos

1. **Keep videos short**: Aim for 10-30 seconds that can loop seamlessly
2. **Remove audio**: Background videos should not have audio
3. **Simple motion**: Use videos with smooth, subtle motion
4. **Compress efficiently**: Use the optimizer script for best results
5. **Test on mobile**: Ensure performance is acceptable on mobile devices
