      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Atomic User Signup and Profile Creation' task into subtasks covering: 1. Supabase Edge Function development for profile insertion triggered by `auth.users` new record. 2. Logic within the Edge Function for username uniqueness handling (COALESCE logic, potential race condition mitigation). 3. Signup UI updates to inform users if their email will be used as username. 4. Comprehensive error logging within the Edge Function. 5. Writing integration tests for atomicity, successful signups (with/without username), and failure scenarios (e.g., profile insert fail).",
      "reasoning": "Involves backend (Edge Function), data consistency across tables, race condition considerations, and UI feedback, making it moderately complex."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Refactor Author Username Display to use DB JOINs' task into subtasks for: 1. Identifying all backend queries/RPC functions (e.g., `get_thread_list`, `get_comment_tree`) that fetch author usernames. 2. Modifying these queries/RPCs to use JOINs with the `profiles` table to retrieve current usernames. 3. Thoroughly testing the dynamic username display across threads and replies, including after a user updates their profile. 4. Conducting performance analysis of the modified queries to ensure no significant degradation. 5. Planning and (post-successful testing and approval) executing the removal of denormalized `author_username` columns from `threads` and `thread_replies` tables, including data migration if necessary.",
      "reasoning": "Involves modifications to multiple backend queries, potential database schema alteration (column removal), and requires performance testing."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Refine Game Genre Filtering and Implement Search Debouncing'. For Genre Filtering: 1. Analyze feasibility and implement Option 1 (tag-based: schema change for `games.genre_tags TEXT[]`, GIN index, update backend logic for case-insensitive exact tag matches, update frontend UI if needed) OR 2. Implement Option 2 (improve string-based splitting and ensure case-insensitive exact matches). For Search Debouncing: 3. Implement or reuse a debounce utility function. 4. Apply debouncing to the game search input field in `js/games.js`. 5. Apply debouncing to the forum header search input in `forum.html`. 6.
