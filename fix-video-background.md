# Video Background Fix Plan

## Current Issue
The video background on the community page is failing to load because:
1. The code is trying to load optimized versions of the video (WebM, H.265) that don't exist in the Supabase bucket
2. The original video file exists but may be too large or in a format that causes loading delays

## Immediate Fix
We've implemented the following changes:
1. Modified the code to load only the original MP4 video file directly
2. Added error handling to gracefully fall back to a static gradient background
3. Added a HEAD request check before attempting to preload the video
4. Simplified the video loading process to avoid unnecessary complexity

## Long-Term Solution

### 1. Optimize the Video
Use the `video-optimizer.js` script to create optimized versions of the video:
```bash
node video-optimizer.js path/to/downloaded/video.mp4
```

This will create:
- WebM versions (more efficient)
- H.265/HEVC versions (better compression)
- Multiple quality levels (high, medium, low)

### 2. Generate a Poster Image
Use the `generate-poster.js` script to create a poster image:
```bash
node generate-poster.js
```

This will download the video and extract a frame to use as a poster image.

### 3. Upload to Supabase
Upload all optimized files to your Supabase bucket:
- High quality: original resolution (max 1280px width)
- Medium quality: 854px width
- Low quality: 640px width

Ensure all files follow the naming convention expected by the code:
- Original: `A_hyperrealistic_cinematic_202506141547.mp4`
- Medium quality: `A_hyperrealistic_cinematic_202506141547-medium.mp4`
- Low quality: `A_hyperrealistic_cinematic_202506141547-low.mp4`
- WebM versions: `.webm` extension instead of `.mp4`
- H.265 versions: `-h265.mp4` suffix

### 4. Update the Code
Once all files are uploaded, revert to using the optimized loading code that selects the appropriate video format and quality based on the user's device and connection.

## Monitoring
After implementing these changes, monitor:
1. Video loading performance
2. Error rates in the console
3. User experience metrics (if available)

If issues persist, consider further optimizing the video or using a CDN for better delivery performance.
