# üß™ Final Testing & Validation Checklist

## üö® **CRITICAL: Run Database Fix First**

**Before any testing, run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- Remove conflicting get_thread_list functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_thread_list(integer, integer, text, text);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_thread_list(integer, integer, uuid, text);

-- Verify only one function remains
SELECT proname, pronargs, proargtypes::regtype[] 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'get_thread_list';
```
