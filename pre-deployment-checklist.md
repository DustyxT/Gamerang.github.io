# Pre-Deployment Checklist for Gamerang

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Deployment)

### Database Issues
- [ ] **Resolve conflicting RPC functions**: You have 3 different `get_thread_list` functions - consolidate to one
- [ ] **Verify database schema**: Ensure all expected columns exist (`last_activity_at`, `is_pinned`, `is_locked`)
- [ ] **Test all RPC function calls** from the frontend

### JavaScript/Frontend Issues  
- [ ] **Fix category validation** in `forum.js` - add proper integer validation for `categoryId`
- [ ] **Standardize Supabase imports** - use consistent import pattern across all files
- [ ] **Test profile creation edge cases** - ensure no race conditions in signup process
- [ ] **Add error handling** for all database operations

### Security & Performance
- [ ] **Environment variables**: Ensure all API keys are properly configured for production
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Add protection against spam/abuse
- [ ] **Image upload limits**: Set proper file size and type restrictions
- [ ] **SQL injection protection**: Verify all user inputs are properly sanitized

## Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] User signup/signin works reliably
- [ ] Thread creation works 100% of the time
- [ ] Image uploads work consistently
- [ ] Forum browsing and filtering
- [ ] Game submission and browsing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Invalid form submissions
- [ ] Network errors during operations
- [ ] Large file uploads
- [ ] Special characters in usernames/content
- [ ] Concurrent user actions

## Production Configuration
- [ ] **Database**: Production Supabase instance configured
- [ ] **Environment**: All environment variables set for production
- [ ] **CDN/Assets**: Static files properly served
- [ ] **SSL/HTTPS**: Secure connections enabled
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Error tracking and analytics set up
- [ ] **Backups**: Database backup strategy in place

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Image optimization**: Compression and resizing
- [ ] **Caching**: Static asset caching configured
- [ ] **Database indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] **Video background**: Test on various devices and connections

## Estimated Timeline
- **Critical fixes**: 1-2 days
- **Testing**: 2-3 days  
- **Production setup**: 1 day
- **Total**: ~1 week

## Current Status: ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (Close but needs fixes)

The platform has solid foundations but the database conflicts and JavaScript validation issues could cause user-facing problems in production.
